"""Multi-state model of interconnection queue progression.

Projects move through a chain of milestones: queue entry → IA signed → operational.
At any point, a project can be withdrawn (absorbing). We treat this as a
continuous-time Markov chain with piecewise-constant hazards estimated empirically
from the LBNL resolved cohort.

States (coarse, supported directly by LBNL date columns):

    SUBMITTED ─────► IA_SIGNED ─────► OPERATIONAL
        │               │
        ▼               ▼
    WITHDRAWN       WITHDRAWN

The finer PJM milestone chain (Feasibility → SIS → Facilities → IA) requires
multiple snapshots to observe transitions and is left as a follow-up; the same
hazard-estimation machinery extends to it directly.
